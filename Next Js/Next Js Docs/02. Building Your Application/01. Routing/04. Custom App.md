## Custom App

The Component prop is the active page, so whenever you navigate between routes, Component will change to the new page. Therefore, any props you send to Component will be received by the page.

pageProps is an object with the initial props that were preloaded for your page by one of our data fetching methods, otherwise it's an empty object.

The App.getInitialProps receives a single argument called context.ctx. It's an object with the same set of properties as the context object in getInitialProps

```
To override the default App, create the file pages/_app.js as shown below:

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}
```
