## Dynamic Routes

1. Convention

   [folderName]. Dynamic Segments can be access from useRouter.

2. Example

```
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function Page() {
const router = useRouter();
return <p>Post: {router.query.slug}</p>;
}
```

3. Catch-all Segments

   Dynamic Segments can be extended to catch-all subsequent segments by adding an ellipsis inside the brackets [...folderName].

4. Optional Catch-all Segments

   Catch-all Segments can be made optional by including the parameter in double square brackets: [[...folderName]].

   The difference between catch-all and optional catch-all segments is that with optional, the route without the parameter is also matched
