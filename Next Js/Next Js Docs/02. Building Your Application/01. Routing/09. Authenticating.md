## Authenticating

Authentication verifies who a user is, while authorization controls what a user can access.

1. Authentication Patterns

   There are two main patterns:

   1. Use static generation to server-render a loading state, followed by fetching user data client-side.
   2. Fetch user data server-side to eliminate a flash of unauthenticated content.
