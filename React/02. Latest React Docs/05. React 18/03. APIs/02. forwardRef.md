# forwardRef

forwardRef lets your component expose a DOM node to parent component with a ref.

```
const SomeComponent = forwardRef(render)
```

## Reference

## Returns

forwardRef returns a React component that you can render in JSX. Unlike React components defined as plain functions, a component returned by forwardRef is also able to receive a ref prop.

## Caveats

## render function 

forwardRef accepts a render function as an argument. React calls this function with props and ref:

```
const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {
  return (
    <label>
      {props.label}
      <input ref={ref} />
    </label>
  );
});
```

## Parameters

## Returns

forwardRef returns a React component that you can render in JSX. Unlike React components defined as plain functions, the component returned by forwardRef is able to take a ref prop.

## Usage

1. Exposing a DOM node to the parent component 

2. Forwarding a ref through multiple components 

3. Exposing an imperative handle instead of a DOM node 

Instead of exposing an entire DOM node, you can expose a custom object, called an imperative handle, with a more constrained set of methods. To do this, youâ€™d need to define a separate ref to hold the DOM node:

```
import { forwardRef, useRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react';

const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {
    return {
      focus() {
        inputRef.current.focus();
      },
      scrollIntoView() {
        inputRef.current.scrollIntoView();
      },
    };
  }, []);

  return <input {...props} ref={inputRef} />;
});
```

**Pitfall** : Do not overuse refs.
