## Usage

1. Displaying a fallback while content is loading

**Note** : Only Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component. They include:

- Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js.
- Lazy-loading component code with lazy.

Suspense does not detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.

2. Revealing content together at once

3. Revealing nested content as it loads

```
<Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>
  <Biography />
  <Suspense fallback={<AlbumsGlimmer />}>
    <Panel>
      <Albums />
    </Panel>
  </Suspense>
</Suspense>
```

4. Showing stale content while fresh content is loading 

```
export default function App() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Search albums:
        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />
      </label>
      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>
        <SearchResults query={query} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  );
}
```

**Note** : Both deferred values and transitions let you avoid showing Suspense fallback in favor of inline indicators.

5. Preventing already revealed content from hiding 

**Note** : Suspense-enabled routers are expected to wrap the navigation updates into transitions by default.

6. Indicating that a transition is happening 

7. Resetting Suspense boundaries on navigation

8. Providing a fallback for server errors and server-only content
