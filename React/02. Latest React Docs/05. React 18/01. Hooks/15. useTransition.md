# useTransition

useTransition is a React Hook that lets you update the state without blocking the UI.

```
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition()
```

## Reference

## Parameters 

useTransition does not take any parameters.

## Returns

useTransition returns an array with exactly two items:

1. The isPending flag - that tells you whether there is a pending transition.
2. The startTransition function - that lets you mark a state update as a transition.

## startTransition function

```
function TabContainer() {
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
  const [tab, setTab] = useState('about');

  function selectTab(nextTab) {
    startTransition(() => {
      setTab(nextTab);
    });
  }
  // ...
}
```

## Returns

startTransition does not return anything.

## Caveats

1. The function you pass to startTransition must be synchronous. React immediately executes this function, marking all state updates that happen while it executes as transitions.  If you try to perform more state updates later (for example, in a timeout), they wonâ€™t be marked as transitions.

## Usage

1. Marking a state update as a non-blocking transition

2. Updating the parent component in a transition

3. Displaying a pending visual state during the transition 

4. Preventing unwanted loading indicators

5. Building a Suspense-enabled router

**Note** : Suspense-enabled routers are expected to wrap the navigation updates into transitions by default.
