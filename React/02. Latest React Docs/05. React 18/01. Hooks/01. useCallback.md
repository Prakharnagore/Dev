# useCallback

useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders until its dependencies change.

```
const handleSubmit = useCallback(fn, dependencies)

```

## Return

On the initial render, useCallback returns the fn function you have passed.
During subsequent renders, it will either return an already stored fn  function from the last render (if the dependencies haven’t changed), or return the fn function you have passed during this render.

## Usage

1. Skipping re-rendering of components

**DEEP DIVE** : How is useCallback related to useMemo?

- useMemo caches the result of calling your function.
```
  const requirements = useMemo(() => { // Calls your function and caches its result
    return computeRequirements(product);
  }, [product]);
```

- useCallback caches the function itself. Unlike useMemo, it does not call the function you provide. Instead, it caches the function you provided 
```
const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => { // Caches your function itself
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }, [productId, referrer]);

```

If you’re already familiar with useMemo, you might find it helpful to think of useCallback as this:

// Simplified implementation (inside React)
function useCallback(fn, dependencies) {
  return useMemo(() => fn, dependencies);
}

**Deep Dive** : Should you add useCallback everywhere? 
Caching a function with useCallback  is only valuable in a few cases:
- You pass it as a prop to a component wrapped in memo, to skip re-rendering if the value hasn’t changed. Memoization lets your component re-render only if dependencies changed.
- The function you’re passing is later used as a dependency of some Hook.

**Note** : Note that useCallback does not prevent creating the function. You’re always creating a function (and that’s fine!), but React ignores it and gives you back a cached function if nothing changed.

2. Updating state from a memoized callback

```
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

  const handleAddTodo = useCallback((text) => {
    const newTodo = { id: nextId++, text };
    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);
  }, [todos]);
```

3. Preventing an Effect from firing too often

```
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const createOptions = useCallback(() => {
    return {
      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',
      roomId: roomId
    };
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = createOptions();
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [createOptions]); // ✅ Only changes when createOptions changes
  // ...
```

4. Optimizing a custom Hook

If you’re writing a custom Hook, it’s recommended to wrap any functions that it returns into useCallback:

```
function useRouter() {
  const { dispatch } = useContext(RouterStateContext);

  const navigate = useCallback((url) => {
    dispatch({ type: 'navigate', url });
  }, [dispatch]);

  const goBack = useCallback(() => {
    dispatch({ type: 'back' });
  }, [dispatch]);

  return {
    navigate,
    goBack,
  };
}
```
