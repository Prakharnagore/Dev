## Usage

**Pitfall** : Do not call useId to generate keys in a list. Keys should be generated from your data.

1. Generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes

**Pitfall** : With server rendering, useId requires an identical component tree on the server and the client. If the trees you render on the server and the client don’t match exactly, the generated IDs won’t match.

**Deep Dive** : Why is useId better than an incrementing counter?

The primary benefit of useId is that React ensures that it works with server rendering. During server rendering, your components generate HTML output. Later, on the client, hydration attaches your event handlers to the generated HTML. For hydration to work, the client output must match the server HTML.

This is very difficult to guarantee with an incrementing counter because the order in which the client components are hydrated may not match the order in which the server HTML was emitted. By calling useId, you ensure that hydration will work, and the output will match between the server and the client.

Inside React, useId is generated from the “parent path” of the calling component. This is why, if the client and the server tree are the same, the “parent path” will match up regardless of rendering order.
