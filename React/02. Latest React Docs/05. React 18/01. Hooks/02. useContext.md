# useContext

useContext is a React Hook that lets you read and subscribe to context from your component.

```
const value = useContext(SomeContext)
```

## Reference

## Returns

**useContext** returns the context value for the calling component. It is determined as the value passed to the closest SomeContext.Provider above the calling component in the tree. If there is no such provider, then the returned value will be the defaultValue you have passed to createContext for that context. The returned value is always up-to-date. React automatically re-renders components that read some context if it changes.

## Caveats

## Usage

1. Passing data deeply into the tree

**Pitfall** : useContext() always looks for the closest provider above the component that calls it. It searches upwards and does not consider providers in the component from which youâ€™re calling useContext().

2. Updating data passed via context

3. Specifying a fallback default value

```
const ThemeContext = createContext('light');
```

4. Overriding context for a part of the tree

you can nest and override providers as many times as you need.

```
<ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
  ...
  <ThemeContext.Provider value="light">
    <Footer />
  </ThemeContext.Provider>
  ...
</ThemeContext.Provider>
```

5. Optimizing re-renders when passing objects and functions 

```
import { useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';

function MyApp() {
  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(null);

  const login = useCallback((response) => {
    storeCredentials(response.credentials);
    setCurrentUser(response.user);
  }, []);

  const contextValue = useMemo(() => ({
    currentUser,
    login
  }), [currentUser, login]);

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
      <Page />
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
}
```
