## Usage

1. Connecting to an external system

External system means any piece of code that’s not controlled by React, such as:
1. A timer managed with setInterval() and clearInterval().
2. An event subscription using window.addEventListener() and window.removeEventListener().
3. A third-party animation library with an API like animation.start() and animation.reset().
