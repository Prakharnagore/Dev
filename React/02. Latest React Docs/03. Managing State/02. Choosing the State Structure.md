**Deep Dive** : Donâ€™t mirror props in state

```
function Message({ messageColor }) {
  const [color, setColor] = useState(messageColor);
}

function Message({ initialColor }) {
  // The `color` state variable holds the *first* value of `initialColor`.
  // Further changes to the `initialColor` prop are ignored.
  const [color, setColor] = useState(initialColor);

```
Here, a color state variable is initialized to the messageColor prop. The problem is that if the parent component passes a different value of messageColor later (for example, 'red' instead of 'blue'), the color state variable would not be updated! The state is only initialized during the first render.
