# Passing Data Deeply with Context

Context lets you pass information deep down to other components

## The problem with passing props 

Prop drilling is a situation where data is passed from one component through multiple interdependent components until you get to the component where the data is needed.

## Context: an alternative to passing props

```
import { createContext } from 'react';

1. const ThemeContext = React.createContext("dark");
2. <ThemeContext.Provider value={level}></ThemeContext>
3. const data = useContext(ThemeContext);
```
