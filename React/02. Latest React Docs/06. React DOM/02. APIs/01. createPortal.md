# createPortal

createPortal lets you render some children into a different part of the DOM.

```
createPortal(children, domNode)
```

## Reference

No Paragraph Found

## Parameters

No Paragraph Found

## Returns

createPortal returns a React node that can be included into JSX or returned from a React component. 

## Caveats

Events from portals propagate according to the React tree rather than the DOM tree. For example, if you click inside a portal, and the portal is wrapped in <div onClick>, that onClick handler will fire. If this causes issues, either stop the event propagation from inside the portal, or move the portal itself up in the React tree.

## Usage

1. Rendering to a different part of the DOM

2. Rendering a modal dialog with a portal 

**Pitfall**: No Paragraph Found

3. Rendering React components into non-React server markup 

4. Rendering React components into non-React DOM nodes
