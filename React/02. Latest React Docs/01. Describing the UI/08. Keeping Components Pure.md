# Keeping Components Pure

## Purity: Components as formulas

Pure functions don’t mutate variables outside of the function’s scope or objects that were created before the call—that makes them impure!. However, it’s completely fine to change variables and objects that you’ve just created while rendering. In

## Side Effects: (un)intended consequences

**Deep Dive** : Detecting impure calculations with StrictMode
In React there are three kinds of inputs that you can read while rendering: 
1. props
2. state
3. context. 

React offers a “Strict Mode” in which it calls each component’s function twice during development. By calling the component functions twice, Strict Mode helps find components that break these rules. (i.e Purity of components)

## Local mutation: Your component’s little secret 

Pure functions don’t mutate variables outside of the function’s scope or objects that were created before the call—that makes them impure!. However, it’s completely fine to change variables and objects that you’ve just created while rendering. In
