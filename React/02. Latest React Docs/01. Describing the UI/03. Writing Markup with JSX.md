## The Rules of JSX

1. Return a single root element
   **Deep Dive**: JSX is transformed into plain JavaScript objects. You can’t return two objects from a function without wrapping them into an array. This explains why you also can’t return two JSX tags without wrapping them into another tag or a Fragment.

2. Close all the tags

3. camelCase all most of the things!
   React, many HTML and SVG attributes are written in camelCase

**Pitfall** : For historical reasons, aria-_ and data-_ attributes are written as in HTML with dashes.
