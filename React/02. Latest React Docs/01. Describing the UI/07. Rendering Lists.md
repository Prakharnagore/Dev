## Rules of keys

1. Keys must be unique among siblings. However, it’s okay to use the same keys for JSX nodes in different arrays.
2. Keys must not change or that defeats their purpose! Don’t generate them while rendering.

## Why does React need keys?

Keys tell React which array item each component corresponds to, so that it can match them up later. This becomes important if your array items can move (e.g. due to sorting), get inserted, or get deleted. A well-chosen key helps React infer what exactly has happened, and make the correct updates to the DOM tree.

**Pitfall**: You might be tempted to use an item’s index in the array as its key. However it is not recommended. The reason for this is that using the index as the key can cause issues when the list of items is updated. If an item is added or removed from the list, the indexes of the remaining items may change, causing React to re-render more items than necessary. This can lead to performance issues, particularly in large lists.
