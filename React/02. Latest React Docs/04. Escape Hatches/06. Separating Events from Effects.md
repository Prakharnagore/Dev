## Declaring an Effect Event - This section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React.

Use a special Hook called useEffectEvent to extract this non-reactive logic out of your Effect:

This solves the problem. Note that you had to remove onConnected from the list of your Effect’s dependencies. Effect Events are not reactive and must be omitted from dependencies.

```
function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {

  const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => {
    showNotification('Connected!', theme);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      onConnected();
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared

```

## Reading latest props and state with Effect Events

```

 const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedUrl => {
    logVisit(visitedUrl, numberOfItems);
  });

   useEffect(() => {
    onVisit(url);
  }, [url]); // ✅ All dependencies declared

```

**Deep Dive** : Is it okay to suppress the dependency linter instead? 
useEffectEvent may help in this case.

## Limitations of Effect Events 

1. Only call them from inside Effects.
2. Never pass them to other components or Hooks.

Effect Events are non-reactive “pieces” of your Effect code.
