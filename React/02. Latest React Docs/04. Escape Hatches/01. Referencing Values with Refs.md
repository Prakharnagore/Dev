# Referencing Values with Refs

When you want component to remember information but dont want to use trigger new renders, you can use a ref.

## Adding a ref to your component

const ref = useRef(0);
{ 
  current: 0 // The value you passed to useRef
}

## Example: building a stopwatch

## Differences between refs and state

Refs: 
1. Doesn’t trigger re-render when you change it.
2. Mutable
3. should not read or right current value during rendering

State:
1. Triggers re-render 
2. Immutable
3. You can read state at any time. 

**Deep Dive** : How does useRef work inside? 
// Inside of React
function useRef(initialValue) {
  const [ref, unused] = useState({ current: initialValue });
  return ref;
}

## When to use refs 

1. Storing timeout IDs
2. Storing and manipulating DOM elements, which we cover on the next page
3. Storing other objects that aren’t necessary to calculate the JSX.

## Refs and the DOM

When you pass a ref to a ref attribute in JSX, like <div ref={myRef}>. React will put the corresponding DOM element into myRef.current.
