## Wrapping an event handler from the props

Since onReceiveMessage is a dependency, it would cause the Effect to re-synchronize after every parent re-render. This would make it re-connect to the chat. To solve this, wrap the call in an Effect Event:

```
function ChatRoom({ roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

  const onMessage = useEffectEvent(receivedMessage => {
    onReceiveMessage(receivedMessage);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      onMessage(receivedMessage);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
```
