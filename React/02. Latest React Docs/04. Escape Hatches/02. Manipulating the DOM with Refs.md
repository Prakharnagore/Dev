# Manipulating the DOM with Refs

Sometimes you might need access to the DOM elements managed by React—for example, to focus a node, scroll to it, or measure its size and position. There is no built-in way to do those things in React, so you will need a ref to the DOM node.

## Accessing another component’s DOM nodes

forwardRef((props,ref)=>{})

```
const MyInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <input {...props} ref={ref} />;
});
```

**DEEP DIVE**: Exposing a subset of the API with an imperative handle?

Inside forwardRef component :

```
useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
// Only expose focus and nothing else
focus() {
realInputRef.current.focus();
},
}));
```

## When React attaches the refs

In React, every update is split in two phases:

1. During render, React calls your components to figure out what should be on the screen.
2. During commit, React applies changes to the DOM.

React sets ref.current during the commit. Before updating the DOM, React sets the affected ref.current values to null. After updating the DOM, React immediately sets them to the corresponding DOM nodes.

flushSync(() => {
  setTodos([ ...todos, newTodo]);
});
