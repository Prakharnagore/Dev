# Queueing a Series of State Updates

## React batches state updates

React waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates. his behavior, also known as batching.

## Updating the same state multiple times before the next render

```
<button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
}}>+3</button>
```

Here, n => n + 1 is called an updater function. During the next render, React goes through the queue and gives you the final updated state. React stores 3 as the final result and returns it from useState.

**Recap** : 
1. Setting state does not change the variable in the existing render, but it requests a new render.
2. React processes state updates after event handlers have finished running. This is called batching.
3. To update some state multiple times in one event, you can use setNumber(n => n + 1) updater function.
