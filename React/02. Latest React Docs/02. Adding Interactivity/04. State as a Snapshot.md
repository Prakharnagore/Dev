# State as a Snapshot


## Setting state triggers renders

## Rendering takes a snapshot in time 

“Rendering” means that React is calling your component, which is a function. The JSX you return from that function is like a snapshot of the UI in time. Its props, event handlers, and local variables were all calculated using its state at the time of the render.

When React re-renders a component:

1. React calls your function again.
2. Your function returns a new JSX snapshot.
3. React then updates the screen to match the snapshot you’ve returned.

Setting state only changes it for the next render. 


## State over time

React keeps the state values “fixed” within one render’s event handlers.
Each render’s state values are fixed,

**Recap** :
1. React stores state outside of your component, as if on a shelf.
2. When you call useState, React gives you a snapshot of the state for that render.
3. Variables and event handlers don’t “survive” re-renders. Every render has its own event handlers.
4. Event handlers created in the past have the state values from the render in which they were created.
