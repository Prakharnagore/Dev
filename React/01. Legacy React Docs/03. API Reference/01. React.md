# React Top-Level API

Types of react components

1. React.Component
2. React.PureComponent

React.Component is the base class for React components when they are defined using ES6 classes

If your React componentâ€™s render() function renders the same result given the same props and state, you can use React.PureComponent

```
React.createElement(
type,
[props],
[...children]
)
```
