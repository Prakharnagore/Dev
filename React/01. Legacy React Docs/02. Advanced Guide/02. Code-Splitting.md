# Code-Splitting

Bundling - Bundling is the process of following imported files and merging them into a single file: a “bundle”. 

Code Splitting - As your app grow bundle will grow too. Code-Splitting create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime. Code-splitting lazy load things that are currently needed by the user and avoid loading code that the user may never need.
