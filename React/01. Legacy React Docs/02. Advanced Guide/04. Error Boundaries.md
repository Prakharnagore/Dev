# Error Boundaries

Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. 

Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them.

Error boundaries do not catch errors for: 
1. Event handlers (learn more)
2. Asynchronous code (e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks)
3. Server side rendering
4. Errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children)

try / catch is great but it only works for imperative code,
However, React components are declarative and specify what should be rendered.

```
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    You can also log the error to an error reporting service
    logErrorToMyService(error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children; 
  }
}
```
